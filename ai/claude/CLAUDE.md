# Claude Code

## Agent Protocols

When a situation matches an agent's domain, read the agent file and follow its
protocol before taking action. Agent files live at `~/.claude/agents/`.

| Situation | Agent file | Constraint |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Investigating a bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior | `debugger.md` | Diagnose before fixing |
| Production incident or outage triage | `incident.md` | Read-only investigation |
| Dependency upgrade or framework migration | `migrate.md` | Plan before changing |
| Code review (PR or diff) | `reviewer.md` | Review before approving |
