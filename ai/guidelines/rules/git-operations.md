# Git — Operations

## Worktree-First Development

- Never edit or write files directly on `main`, `master`, or any shared/protected branch — always create a worktree first
- For implementation work on any branch, prefer using a worktree to isolate changes from the working tree — this prevents accidental modifications to uncommitted work and keeps the primary checkout clean
- Read-only operations (searching, reading files, exploring code) do not require a worktree
- Use the `wt` CLI for worktree management (`wt switch -c <branch>`) — never use the built-in `EnterWorktree` tool or the `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` skill

## Cross-Worktree Safety

- Never run tests, builds, or git-mutating commands in a worktree other than the current session's — test harnesses create temporary git repos that can corrupt the target worktree's branch and commit state
- When applying changes to another worktree, only use `git apply` and file copies — then tell the user to run tests there themselves

## Rebase, Cherry-Pick, Merge Conflicts

- During interactive git operations (rebase, cherry-pick, merge conflict resolution), use only Bash commands — the Edit tool can corrupt git's index state and abort the operation
